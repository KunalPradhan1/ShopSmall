# ShopSmall

Introduction

ShopSmall is a brand new shopping website specifically designed to help marketize small businesses. As we know, running a small business is incredibly difficult and thus owners canâ€™t spend time marketing with billboards as they need to tend their budget elsewhere and take care of the business. Thus ShopSmall is designed to specifically help small businesses and allow them to have an online presence that customers can shop from and view their products and business online. Users can choose to either create an account as a business or a customer. A business user can set up their business profile along with their inventory and product information. Users can choose to search what products they desire and add them to their cart.
